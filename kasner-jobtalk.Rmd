1. Natural mineral form of lead(II) sulfide
2. Important ore of lead and source of silver
3. Not harmful to touch or handle

### What's the difference between a hazard and a risk?

- Exposure or action is needed to transform a hazard into a risk

- Hazard is the potential to cause harm, while risk is the
likelihood of harm in defined circumstances

- Hazard is the possibility of something causing harm, while risk
is the probability of something causing harm

### Risk assessment vs. risk perception

- Risk assessment
  - Hazard $\neq$ Risk
  - Risk occurs when there is *exposure* to the hazard
  - **Risk $=$ Hazard $\times$ Exposure**
  
- Risk perception
  - Involves psychosocial factors
  - People consider different things hazardous or risky
  - **Risk $=$ Hazard $+$ Outrage**

## Occupational carcinogens

- Risk = Hazard $\times$ Exposure 
- Workers have had a major role in identifying human carcinogens
- Among 120 IARC Group 1 carcinogens:
    - 40% were identified in occupational studies
    - 60+% have documented occupational exposures
- Progress, but
    - more than 80,000 chemicals used in industry
    - most agents have never been evaluated, so human evidence

???
While we can rate things for an exercise like this, it's different to live in a place where hazards are seen as more risky.

---
### Science and uncertainty

- Scientific work is incomplete
- Scientific work is liable to modification by advancing knowledge 
- That does not confer freedom to ignore current knowledge
- Or postpone action that it appears to demand at a given time

### Conditions for acceptable risk

- Level of risk must be below a threshold
- Benefits must clearly outweigh risks
- Distributional justice: health of a subgroup cannot be sacrificed

### Precautionary principle

**Wingspread Statement:** 

>*“When an activity raises threats to the environment or human health, precautionary measures should be taken, even if some cause-and-effect relationships are not fully established scientifically”*

### What is exposure science?

- Study of contact (e.g. **swallowing, breathing, or touching**) over time and space with environmental factors and their effects on the human body (**"place and time makes the poison"**)

- Scientists seek to understand how various agents are transported across **air, water, and land** and transformed in the human body
- It is problem-based
    - Defines sources, pathways, and routes of exposure
    - Requires measurement, interpretation, and judgment
    - Suggests interventions to be evaluated

---
#### Mathematical definition of exposure

$$E = \int_{t1}^{t2} C(t) dt$$

$E$ = exposure is the integral of a concentration that varies with time between the beginning and end of exposure ( $\frac{mass \times time}{volume}$ )

$C$ = concentration of a substance ( $\frac{mass}{volume}$ ) at any given time $t$

$t_1$ and $t_2$ = beginning and end of exposure, respectively ( $t$ )

#### Thought experiment: mathematical definition of exposure, example 1

$$E = \int_{t1}^{t2} C(t) dt$$

- From 8:30 to 9:50 AM, you are in a room with a constant air concentration of 10 $\mu$g/m<sup>3</sup> of Chemical A. 

- **What is your exposure?**

#### Thought experiment: mathematical definition of exposure, example 2

$$E = \int_{t1}^{t2} C(t) dt$$

- In the room next door, the air concentration of a highly toxic chemical is 50 $\mu$g/m<sup>3</sup>.

- You need to walk through that room to get outdoors. It will take you 10 seconds to walk through the room.

- **What is your exposure?**

Evolution of ag tech

???

This offers a comparison between the evolutionary technological phases of agriculture and general industry. Agriculture 0.0 involved prevalent use of manual labor and animal traction up until 1920 or so. Then, Agriculture 1.0 began with the introduction of diesel engines alongside prevalent manual labor through 1960. Agriculture 2.0 might be defined as the time between 1960 and 1980 when many manual labor tasks were replaced by machines in farm production areas and resulted in increased yields due to genetic and chemical innovations. Agriculture 3.0 from 1980 to 2000 was defined by the introduction of more electronic control systems on board tractors and the first attempts to digitalize farm management.  After 2000, Agriculture 4.0 or “Smart Agriculture” might be defined as the diffusion of tractor position systems, communication protocols, and integrated farm information systems (wireless networks, Bluetooth, cloud computing, artificial intelligence).

Precision ag diagram

???

This is a conceptual diagram of a decision support system from a 1997 NAS report. Tracing the steps in the figure, information can be viewed as flowing from environment via human or instrumented sensors to a database. The data is analyzed and manipulated for storage and transmission to a user as part of a decision process, which results in an action to be executed within the environment. And the cycle continues. 
 
I think I heard this from Cap that about 10% of farms produce roughly 90% of food and are highly engaged in technology. 90% of farms produce less food and might have less technology. The pandemic has increased bandwidth and the next generation of farmers will be very connected. 

Looking ahead with cautious optimism, it may finally be data’s time to shine, but it won’t be without challenges of course. 

---

Ag Tech Landscape

???

We’ve been hearing about data for many years, but translating it into actionable intelligence for the farmer was elusive. With data quality improving and the cost / availability of computing power, artificial intelligence, and machine learning becoming more accessible, the tide might be shifting. This is a closer look at what is happening today. It’s graphic from “Better Food Ventures” and they create heat maps like this. I’ve heard reports of growers in our region using upwards of 20 mobile apps to make decisions on their farms. My interest is: how do you inject occupational safety and health into this picture?

---

Networked farm

???

Historically, measurement of environmental contaminants has posed significant challenges to characterizing human health risks, especially in rural areas. Modern decision support systems are powered by models that analyze vast amounts of data compiled from geospatial, optical, electro-chemical, mechanical, meteorological, and remote sensing technologies. The proliferation of sensor networks has enabled growers to optimize planting decisions, track crop health, and guide agrochemical use.  What tools are we looking at to improve safety and health?

### Reproducible Research

- **Reproducibility:** ability to obtain results by using the same data, code, and procedures

- **Replicability:** ability to arrive at the same scientific conclusions in a new study with new data, possibly different methods, and new analyses

- National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (2019):
    - Summary: [10 Things to Know About Reproducibility and Replicability](https://www.nap.edu/resource/25303/Ten%20Things%20to%20Know%20about%20Reproducibility%20and%20Replicability.pdf)
    
    - Full report: [Reproducibility and Replicability in Science](https://www.nationalacademies.org/our-work/reproducibility-and-replicability-in-science)
    
???

- Two scientists from audience for reproducibility and replicability
- General process has been supercharged by computing and coding
- Transparency, openness.
- Lots of energy around this right now, with good reason to advance since more quickly. 
- Change paradigm to share data and code with a willingness to be critiqued publicly

## Closing thoughts. Self-check. Can I...

  - differentiate risk perception and risk assessment?
  
  - explain the difference between a hazard and a risk?
  
  - give two examples of exposure science in precision agriculture?
  
  - describe reproducibility?

### Exposure science is...

- a science of measurement requiring interpretation and judgment
- a study of time and place (*"place and time makes the poison"*)
- problem-based
    - exposure measurements define sources and pathways
    - suggest interventions to be evaluated
- part of the risk assessment framework

---

### Industrial Hygiene

- **Anticipation:** proactively estimate potential health and safety concerns that are commonly, or at least potentially, associated with a given occupational or environmental setting
- **Recognition:** identify potential and actual hazards in a workplace through direct inspection
- **Evaluation:** measure exposures through visual or instrumental monitoring of a site
- **Control:** reduce the risk to health and safety through administrative engineering measures
