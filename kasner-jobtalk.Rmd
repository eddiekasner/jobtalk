### What's the difference between a hazard and a risk?

- Exposure or action is needed to transform a hazard into a risk

- Hazard is the potential to cause harm, while risk is the
likelihood of harm in defined circumstances

- Hazard is the possibility of something causing harm, while risk
is the probability of something causing harm

### Risk assessment vs. Risk perception

- Risk assessment
  - Hazard $\neq$ Risk
  - Risk occurs when there is *exposure* to the hazard
  - **Risk $=$ Hazard $\times$ Exposure**
  
- Risk perception
  - Includes the lived experience of communities
  - Involves psychosocial factors
  - People consider different things hazardous or risky
  - **Risk $=$ Hazard $+$ Outrage**

---

## Occupational carcinogens

- Risk = Hazard $\times$ Exposure 
- **Workers have had a major role in identifying human carcinogens**
- Among 120 IARC Group 1 carcinogens:
    - 40% were identified in occupational studies
    - 60+% with documented occupational exposures
- Progress, but
    - more than 80,000 chemicals used in industry
    - most agents have never been evaluated, so no human evidence

While we can rate things for an exercise like this, it's different to live in a place where hazards are seen as more risky.

---
### Science and uncertainty

- Scientific work is incomplete
- Scientific work is liable to modification by advancing knowledge 
- That does not confer freedom to ignore current knowledge
- Or postpone action that it appears to demand at a given time

### Conditions for acceptable risk

- Level of risk must be below a threshold
- Benefits must clearly outweigh risks
- Distributional justice: health of a subgroup cannot be sacrificed

## Precautionary principle

**Wingspread Statement:** 

>*“When an activity raises threats to the environment or human health, precautionary measures should be taken, even if some cause-and-effect relationships are not fully established scientifically”*

## What is exposure science?

- Study of contact (e.g. **swallowing, breathing, or touching**) over time and space with environmental factors and their effects on the human body (**"place and time makes the poison"**)

--

- Scientists seek to understand how various agents are transported across **air, water, and land** and transformed in the human body

--

- It is problem-based:
    - Defines sources, pathways, and routes of exposure
    - Requires measurement, interpretation, and judgment
    - Suggests interventions to be evaluated

---

## Industrial Hygiene

- **Anticipation:** proactively estimate potential health and safety concerns that are commonly, or at least potentially, associated with a given occupational or environmental setting
- **Recognition:** identify potential and actual hazards in a workplace through direct inspection
- **Evaluation:** measure exposures through visual or instrumental monitoring of a site
- **Control:** reduce the risk to health and safety through administrative engineering measures

---
### Mathematical definition of exposure

$$E = \int_{t1}^{t2} C(t) dt$$

$E$ = exposure is the integral of a concentration that varies with time between the beginning and end of exposure ( $\frac{mass \times time}{volume}$ )

$C$ = concentration of a substance ( $\frac{mass}{volume}$ ) at any given time $t$

$t_1$ and $t_2$ = beginning and end of exposure, respectively ( $t$ )

### Thought experiment: definition of exposure, example 1

$$E = \int_{t1}^{t2} C(t) dt$$

- From 8:30 to 9:50 AM, you are in a room with a constant air concentration of 10 $\mu$g/m<sup>3</sup> of Chemical A. 

- **What is your exposure?**

### Thought experiment: definition of exposure, example 2

$$E = \int_{t1}^{t2} C(t) dt$$

- In the room next door, the air concentration of a highly toxic chemical is 50 $\mu$g/m<sup>3</sup>.

- You need to walk through that room to get outdoors. It will take you 10 seconds to walk through the room.

### Precision agriculture 25 years ago

```{r precision-ag, echo=FALSE, out.width = '70%', fig.align="center"}

This is a conceptual diagram of a decision support system from a 1997 NAS report. Tracing the steps in the figure, information can be viewed as flowing from environment via human or instrumented sensors to a database. The data is analyzed and manipulated for storage and transmission to a user as part of a decision process, which results in an action to be executed within the environment. And the cycle continues. 
 
I think I heard this from Cap that about 10% of farms produce roughly 90% of food and are highly engaged in technology. 90% of farms produce less food and might have less technology. The pandemic has increased bandwidth and the next generation of farmers will be very connected. 

Looking ahead with cautious optimism, it may finally be data’s time to shine, but it won’t be without challenges of course.

### Agriculture 4.0

This offers a comparison between the evolutionary technological phases of agriculture and general industry. Agriculture 0.0 involved prevalent use of manual labor and animal traction up until 1920 or so. Then, Agriculture 1.0 began with the introduction of diesel engines alongside prevalent manual labor through 1960. Agriculture 2.0 might be defined as the time between 1960 and 1980 when many manual labor tasks were replaced by machines in farm production areas and resulted in increased yields due to genetic and chemical innovations. Agriculture 3.0 from 1980 to 2000 was defined by the introduction of more electronic control systems on board tractors and the first attempts to digitalize farm management.  After 2000, Agriculture 4.0 or “Smart Agriculture” might be defined as the diffusion of tractor position systems, communication protocols, and integrated farm information systems (wireless networks, Bluetooth, cloud computing, artificial intelligence).

Historically, measurement of environmental contaminants has posed significant challenges to characterizing human health risks, especially in rural areas. Modern decision support systems are powered by models that analyze vast amounts of data compiled from geospatial, optical, electro-chemical, mechanical, meteorological, and remote sensing technologies. The proliferation of sensor networks has enabled growers to optimize planting decisions, track crop health, and guide agrochemical use.  What tools are we looking at to improve safety and health? My interest is: how do you inject environmental and occupational safety and health into this picture?

Predictions of the 75th percentile PMC below the canopy for various distances and wind speeds outside of a spray field. Predictions were made from our restricted model (Table 4) using the US EPA's recommended spraying wind speeds of 3–10 MPH (1.3–4.5 m/s). The horizontal line represents the 75th percentile background concentration that was measured below the canopy during this study (13 μg/m3). The y-axis on the right shows the predicted PMC values rescaled relative to the background level. An individual would have to be located a minimum of about 500–600 ft (152–183 m), 340–500 ft (104–152 m) and 340–450 ft (104–137 m) downwind of an AFA, DAT and MFT sprayer application, respectively, before their exposure level was comparable to the background level. At 100 ft (30 m) downwind, their predicted PMC exposure level would be between 230 and 510 μg/m232, 110–230 μg/m3 and 70–160 μg/m3 during an AFA, DAT and MFT sprayer application, respectively. Higher PMC levels for any particular distance are associated with lower wind speeds (less dispersion).

Exceptional drought conditions last summer was not welcome news, especially after last summer. This satellite imagery shows massive wind-driven fires, large dust storms, and wildfire smoke extending across the West on September 7 and 8, 2020.

Tree fruit, wine grapes, hops, and other labor-intensive commodities are cornerstones of the Pacific Northwest agricultural economy. Smoke from recent fires has blanketed agriculturally intensive areas resulting in air quality deemed unhealthy. Increased wildfire activity has occurred during harvest from these crops making tens of thousands of workers and their employers more susceptible to the adverse health effects of smoke based on proximity to fire, larger amounts of time spent outdoors, and some of the higher levels of physical exertion.

#### Air quality monitoring in rural areas 

```{r smoke-event-sensors, echo=FALSE, out.width = '100%', fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/smoke-event-sensors.png")
```

???

We know that air quality monitors cover urban areas much better than rural areas. In Washington, we found that East of the Cascades, only 35 regulatory PM2.5 monitoring sites covered a land area of about 45,000mi2. This amounts to an area of about 1,286 mi2 per monitor or distances that could reach beyond 36 mi, on average. Additionally, there were limited or no air quality monitors in certain rural counties, some with high agricultural production.
One motivation of our recent research is to see if more local air monitoring in rural areas is useful to growers as a decision-support tool for worker, livestock, and crop health. Smoke taint is a growing issue among major fruit and beverage crops.
Some employers voluntarily use AQI classifications to inform decisions about outdoor work and a few states in the west are now requiring it.
